# 1927 Bonus Questions

These are bonus questions if you want to push yourself and do more questions than the labs provide.

Questions are broken up into weeks.
Most of the time, questions will assume you understand the content taught in that week.

Questions are drawn from https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/
