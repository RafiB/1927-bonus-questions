# 1927 Bonus Questions

These are bonus questions if you want to push yourself and do more questions than the labs provide.

Questions are broken up into weeks.
Most of the time, questions will assume you understand the content taught in that week.

Questions are drawn from https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/

To work on a challenge:

  * Open the directory for that challenge
  * Read the instructions in the directory's README
  * Type `make` to compile your code
  * Type `make tests` to test your solution
  * If all the `.o` files are annoying you, `make tidy`

## For tutors (and other awesome people)

If you want to create a new challenge just copy one of the existing challenges
into a new directory and throw that into the right week.

The Makefiles should hopefully be generic enough that adding new files is easy.
