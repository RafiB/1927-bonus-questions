#Fibonacci

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number in the sequence is found by adding up the two previous numbers

Your job is to implement the functions in fibonacci.c

  * `fibonacci` should find the n-th fibonacci number _iteratively_
  * `fibonacci_rec` should find the n-th fibonacci number _recursively_
