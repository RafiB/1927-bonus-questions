#Rotated Arrays

We say that an array B is a "rotation" of array A if array B is identical
to array B, shifted to the right.

Given an array A = {1,2,3,5,6,7,8} valid rotations are:

  1. {8,1,2,3,5,6,7}
  2. {6,7,8,1,2,3,5}
  3. ...

Your job is to implement the function `rotated_array` in `rotated-array.c`.

`rotated_array` should return 1 if b is a valid rotation of a, and return 0
otherwise.
